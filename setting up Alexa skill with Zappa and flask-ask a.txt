setting up Alexa skill with Zappa and flask-ask a few notes:
1.) need to sudo pip install virtualenv. I think my initial install of conda was messing something
up and thus since Zappa needs an active virtual env it wasn't working
2.) Then when trying to test the lambda function it kept saying in the AWS lambda function test 
portal that certain files weren't present like :

{
  "errorMessage": "libssl.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory",
  "errorType": "ImportError"
}ï»¿

This seems to mean the necessary dependency files weren't in the directory that was deployed with 
zappa (not sure why). So I just located this file on local machine and put it into the directoy that
was deployed by zappa. Kept doing this for each file that would subsequently show up. Eventually
worked. (must be better way?)

3.) Then lastly, the https url given is the home address if in your alexa flask-ask app your have 
something like : ask = Ask(app, "/EventDetective") then when setting up the https address in the 
amazon alexa console you have to add /EventDetective to the end of the given url by Zappa to make 
it work properly
