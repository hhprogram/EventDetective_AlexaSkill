# note the ">" character allows me to break up the templates into mult-lines. if do that then need
# to take away the double quotes and then need to start at the next line and then use 2 spaces
# to do multlines and keep double quotes syntax continue the line with \. Then I can keep the dbl
# quotes which is good because only within dbl quotes does \n not escaped and thus dentoes a new 
# line character (syntax seems to get pretty confused though)
