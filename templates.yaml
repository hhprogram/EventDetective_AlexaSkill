# note the ">" character allows me to break up the templates into mult-lines. if do that then need
# to take away the double quotes and then need to start at the next line and then use 2 spaces
# to do multlines and keep double quotes syntax continue the line with \. Then I can keep the dbl
# quotes which is good because only within dbl quotes does \n not escaped and thus dentoes a new 
# line character (syntax seems to get pretty confused though)
welcome: >
  Let's find you something to do!...Let's begin ... you can either go through our Q and A process by 
  responding with the city and state you are interested in or say help...note for best experience 
  you can open the Alexa app and view the Alexa cards with each response
help: > 
  You can bypass the Q and A process by saying city, state, mile radius, category, time period
  all in one sentence ... OR you can say something like What's good in New York, New York and the
  rest of the fields will be set to some defaults. Lastly, at any time in the process you can say 
  Q&A help or list all commands without ending your session...go ahead and try it now!
detailHelp: >
  Q&A process first asks city and state...then time frame...then filtering by category...then 
  the mile radius you are interested in...then the top 10 events should be listed. Say 
  list all commands if curious of all possible commands
allCommands: >
  {% for command, example, result in commands %} {{ command }} command which prompts the user with {{result}}...A way to trigger this is...{{example}} {% endfor %}
timeQ: "What time frame would you like to choose from? {{ aval_time_periods }}"

missedInput: "Please say the {{ input }} you wanted."
testResponse: "hello there"
restart: "Lets start again ... say everything at once or just the city and state"
detailResponse: >
  {{ title }} starts on {{ start }} and ends on {{ end }} at {{ venue }}...
  You can say more info on...whatever other event was listed or say back to hear the list again...
  The description can be seen on the accompanying Alexa app card but if you'd like Alexa to read you 
  the description say ...description please
